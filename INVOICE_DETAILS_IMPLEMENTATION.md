# Invoice Details Page Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the invoice details page for the Tinkso Margin Tracker application. The implementation includes a dynamic route structure, full backend integration, assignment functionality, and comprehensive error handling.

## Implementation Details

### 🛤️ Dynamic Route Structure

**Location**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`

- Dynamic route that captures the invoice ID from the URL
- Supports deep linking to specific invoices
- Proper breadcrumb navigation back to the queue

### 🔧 API Endpoints

#### 1. Individual Invoice Endpoint
**Location**: `/src/app/api/supplier-invoices/[id]/route.ts`

**Methods Supported**:
- `GET` - Fetch complete invoice data with AI results and assignments
- `PUT` - Update invoice details and project assignments
- `DELETE` - Delete invoice and all related data

**Query Parameters**:
- `includeAI=true` - Include AI vision processing results
- `includeAssignments=true` - Include project assignments

#### 2. OCR Processing Endpoint
**Location**: `/src/app/api/supplier-invoices/[id]/process-ocr/route.ts`

- `POST` - Trigger AI vision processing for the invoice
- `GET` - Get current AI vision processing status

### 🎨 UI Components and Features

#### Three-Panel Layout
1. **Left Panel (25%)** - Invoice details and metadata
2. **Center Panel (50%)** - PDF viewer (hidden on mobile)
3. **Right Panel (25%)** - Assignment interface

#### Key Features

##### Edit Mode
- Inline editing of invoice details
- Form validation and error handling
- Save/Cancel functionality with confirmation

##### AI Vision Integration
- Display AI confidence scores and project matches
- One-click assignment from AI suggestions
- Manual re-processing capability

##### Assignment Interface
- Multi-project assignment support
- Amount splitting with validation
- Equal split functionality
- Visual assignment summary

##### PDF Integration
- Embedded PDF viewer using existing `InvoicePdfViewer` component
- Direct PDF access with proxy support

### 📊 Data Flow

```typescript
// 1. Fetch invoice details with related data
GET /api/supplier-invoices/[id]?includeAI=true&includeAssignments=true

// 2. Update invoice details
PUT /api/supplier-invoices/[id]
Body: { supplierName, amountTotal, ... }

// 3. Update project assignments
PUT /api/supplier-invoices/[id]
Body: { status: 'assigned', projectAssignments: [...] }

// 4. Process with AI Vision
POST /api/supplier-invoices/[id]/process-ocr

// 5. Delete invoice
DELETE /api/supplier-invoices/[id]
```

### 🔒 Type Safety

Complete TypeScript interfaces for:
- `SupplierInvoiceWithDetails` - Main invoice data structure
- `ProjectOption` - Available projects for assignment
- Assignment and AI extraction types

### ⚡ Real-time Features

- Auto-refresh after operations
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Success/error message display
- Optimistic UI updates

### 🎯 Assignment Workflow

#### 1. AI-Suggested Assignment
```typescript
// Quick assign from AI matches
const handleAIAssignment = (match) => {
  setSelectedProjects([projectId])
  setSplitAmounts({ [projectId]: invoice.amountTotal })
}
```

#### 2. Manual Assignment
```typescript
// Multi-project assignment with validation
const validateAssignment = () => {
  const totalAssigned = selectedProjects.reduce((sum, projectId) => 
    sum + (splitAmounts[projectId] || equalShare), 0
  )
  return Math.abs(totalAssigned - invoice.amountTotal) <= 0.01
}
```

#### 3. Assignment Types
- `manual` - User-created assignments
- `ai` - AI-suggested assignments
- `bulk` - Batch assignments

### 🛡️ Error Handling

#### Client-Side
- Form validation before submission
- Amount validation for assignments
- Network error handling
- User-friendly error messages

#### Server-Side
- Authentication checks
- Data validation
- Foreign key constraints
- Transaction rollback on errors

### 📱 Responsive Design

- Three-panel layout on desktop (XL screens)
- Two-panel layout on tablets (LG screens)
- Single-panel layout on mobile
- PDF viewer hidden on small screens

### 🔄 Integration Points

#### Existing Components
- `InvoicePdfViewer` - PDF display
- `shadcn/ui` components - UI consistency
- Existing API patterns - Code reuse

#### Database Operations
- Supplier invoice CRUD
- Project assignment management
- AI processing results
- Audit trail maintenance

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/invoices/[id]` with a valid invoice ID
2. Test edit mode functionality
3. Test AI vision processing
4. Test project assignment workflow
5. Test error scenarios

### API Testing
Use the provided test script:
```bash
node test-invoice-details-api.js
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation
```typescript
// From queue page
<Link href={`/invoices/${invoice.id}`}>
  View Details
</Link>
```

### Direct API Usage
```typescript
// Fetch invoice details
const response = await fetch(`/api/supplier-invoices/${id}?includeAI=true&includeAssignments=true`)
const { invoice } = await response.json()

// Update assignment
await fetch(`/api/supplier-invoices/${id}`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'assigned',
    projectAssignments: [...]
  })
})
```

## Security Considerations

- Authentication required for all operations
- User authorization checks
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection through proper escaping

## Performance Optimizations

- Efficient data fetching with selective includes
- Debounced form updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Lazy loading of non-critical data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-invoice assignment
2. **History Tracking**: Detailed audit logs
3. **Notifications**: Real-time updates
4. **Export**: PDF/Excel export functionality
5. **Comments**: Invoice collaboration features
